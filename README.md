This repository contains tasks completed as part of the Graduate Rotational Internship Program (GRIP) with The Sparks Foundation.

#
# Task 1
## Prediction using Supervised ML
Objective: Predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours.

Question: What will be the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/day?

Method: Simple linear regression as it involves just 2 variables.

Dataset: http://bit.ly/w-data
#
# Task 2
## Prediction using Unsupervised ML
Objective: Predict the optimum number of clusters from the given Iris dataset and represent it visually.
